# NestFund Stub Pack â€” 2025-08-15

Branch suggestion: feature/day-07-subpages-calculator-grants

This pack contains starter files and directories referenced in today's plan so you can open a clean PR immediately.

## How to use
1) Create a new branch in your repo: `feature/day-07-subpages-calculator-grants`
2) Copy the contents of this zip into the repo root (it already contains the /docs, /site, /marketing, /design, /grants, /qa folders).
3) Commit and push.
4) Open a PR using `/docs/pm/pr-template.md` for your summary.

## Notes
- If your hosting is fully static, you can't use PHP includes. For `/site/includes/disclaimer.html`, either inline the content at build time or use your static site generator's include mechanism.
- Stubs are intentionally minimal. Fill content per the role (COPY, DEV, BRAND, GRANTS).
